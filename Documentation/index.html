What is Sparks?
<dd>It's a Javascript framework built upon MochiKit covering:
<ul>
<li>Data structures
<li>Events
<li>Presentation
<li>Effects
<li>Asynchrony
</ul>
<dt>
Why write another framework?
<dd>Sparks is an approach to client-side frameworks based around transparency. Instead of giving you monolithic objects with approachabilty only at the top level, Sparks is built upon itself; Each layer builds on the strength of the ones beneath it, allowing developers to choose their own level of detail, instead of being forced down a single, rigid path.
<dt>
What isn't Sparks?
<dd>Sparks is not intended to be a out-of-the-box widget set. It's not a DSL. It won't overload your basic Javascript objects.
<dt>What's "transparency" mean? Layers?
<dd>
Sparks takes inheritance and contractualness very seriously. For a simple example, the Button object is a Widget, which is an Event Source. All objects in this chain are real objects with distinct roles - there is no padding of the dependency tree just for the sake of it.
